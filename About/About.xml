  <description>Sets the volume of the main menu music to 0, muting it.
If you're like me, you spend a lot of time in the menu creating your pawns and ideologies, and want to play your own music outside of the game while doing so. It's annoying to have to mute the game's audio every time and then unmute once you start playing again. So I made this to simply mute the main menu music.
It's not a bad song, I'm just a little tired of it.
  
Only marked as supporting 1.3 but it honestly should work with any version.</description>
